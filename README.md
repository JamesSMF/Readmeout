# Readmeout

## What is it
If you are a lazy guy like me, and want to read these holy fucking long passages easily, this simple program is designed for you. You only need to type `python3 readmeout.py` and enjoy.

## How do you use it
1. Make sure you have python installed on your local machine (python3 preferred, but is also compatible with python2)
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy the text you would like the program to read out to `to_be_read.txt` file
4. Type `python3 readmeout.py` and enjoy
