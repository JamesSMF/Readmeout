Much of the press portrayed fundamentalism as a movement of back- woods bigots. In fact, it was a national phenomenon. Even in New York City, the center of the new mod- ern culture, Fosdick was removed from his ministry in 1924 (whereupon John D. Rockefeller Jr. built the interdenominational Riverside Church for him). Fundamentalism remained an important strain of 1920s culture and politics. Prohibition, which fun- damentalists strongly supported, succeeded in reducing the consumption of alcohol as well as pub- lic drunkenness and drink-related diseases. Not until 1975 would per capita consumption of alcohol reach its pre-Prohibition level of 2.6 gallons per year.
